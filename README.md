## Project Name
ATA (AntiThreatActor)

## Description
A repository to list classify all JARM hashes from any phishing/malware campaigns I come by, so it can be easier to identify the threat actor / campaign. Also includes some metadata / key information about the campaign and features that the campaign follows.


## Folder Structure

Here is a hint for how the folders are structured in this repository

```
root/     # Root directory for all the campaigns.
|- Alife12_EE_AF_AW_KO/    # Sub folder for all variations of the email spammer & main information about it
```

## Notes

Please be sure to check out the JARM project which is used in this project to provide TLS fingerprinting on github here (https://github.com/salesforce/jarm), personally I think it is an amazing tool to use for any cyber forensics / info security task.
